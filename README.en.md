## From an idea to a video

| Step | What you can do |
|---|---|
| **Create in chat** | Describe a video using DSH's native conversation and models. Keep refining the same project. |
| **Preview as you go** | Automatically refresh the preview, play, pause, and seek. |
| **Edit across tracks** | Import images, video, and audio; move, trim, split, duplicate, reorder, and snap clips. |
| **See your sound** | Inspect real waveforms and continuous thumbnails. Detach video audio into its own track. |
| **Keep your progress** | Share undo/redo between AI and manual edits. Projects persist across restarts. |
| **Export a finished video** | Render H264/AAC MP4 with progress and cancellation. |

## Installation

Requires **DeepSeek Harness ≥ 0.2.1-rc.2, Node.js ≥ 22, FFmpeg/ffprobe, and Google Chrome**.

Open DSH **Plugins → Add plugin**, enter one of the following sources, install, and enable:

### GitHub repository

```text
https://github.com/heswy/dsh-video-editor
```

### npm package

```text
dsh-video-editor
```

Use the official npm registry for installation.

See the [installation guide](docs/releases/UPDATE-CHANNEL.md) for more options.

## Quick start

1. Open **dsh-video-editor** in the DSH sidebar. Create or open a project.
2. Describe the video in the right-hand conversation; the preview updates on the left.
3. Continue in chat or edit clips on the timeline. Import your own media through **素材 / Assets**.
4. Choose **Export MP4**, wait for rendering, and save your video.

Try an idea like this:

> Make a 15-second product introduction with a dark background. Use three sections for the title, key features, and closing line. Keep transitions simple.

Projects save automatically to `~/Movies/DSH Video` and use your DSH model configuration.

## Updates, disabling, and rollback

Use **Plugin updates** in the editor toolbar to check and install new versions.

Disable the plugin from DSH's plugin page. To roll back, reinstall the previous version. Project data is saved independently.

## Development

```sh
git clone https://github.com/heswy/dsh-video-editor.git
cd dsh-video-editor
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm run check
node --test tests/*.test.mjs
```

The runtime loads JavaScript directly. `host/` owns project, session, and resource boundaries; `client.js` provides the native workspace; `packages/` contains the independent engine. Read [development rules](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) and the [publishing guide](docs/releases/UPDATE-CHANNEL.md).

Report problems through [Issues](https://github.com/heswy/dsh-video-editor/issues) with your DSH/plugin version, device, and reproduction steps. See [SECURITY](SECURITY.md) for vulnerability reports.
